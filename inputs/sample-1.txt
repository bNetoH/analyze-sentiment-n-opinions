My Experience with 5starsNetwork's Broadband Service â€“ It Could Be Better
The promise was of a fast and stable connection, but the reality was quite different. During the first few days, the speed seemed to meet expectations, but I soon noticed frequent drops and fluctuations that hindered both remote work and streaming. During peak hours, the internet was considerably slower than contracted.
Technical support was a reasonable point. When I needed assistance, the wait time at the center was acceptable, and the attendants were polite. However, resolving the problems took longer than expected. I had to call more than once to get a definitive solution for a recurring instability.
The installation process was relatively quick, and the technicians were punctual. They explained the basic operation of the equipment and performed initial tests. However, the router provided was not the best, and I needed to make adjustments to improve the signal inside the house.
The price of the plan is within the market average, but for the service provided, I do not feel it is good value for money. If the speed were more stable and there were fewer drops, it would be worth it. As it is, it seems like I'm paying more than I actually get.
The standard router has a limited range, and in more distant rooms, the signal drops considerably. I had to invest in a repeater to improve coverage inside the house, something that could be better solved with more powerful equipment right from the installation.
There are days when the internet works well and others when there are instabilities for no apparent reason. Even without total drops, the ping and latency vary a lot, which mainly affects online games and video calls.
The service works most of the time, but it doesn't deliver everything it promises. For those who need a reliable connection for work or entertainment without interruptions, it can be frustrating. With some improvements in the infrastructure and faster support, the experience could be much better.
If there are no better options in the region, it may be a viable choice. Otherwise, it's worth researching other alternatives before signing a contract.
