My Experience at the Hotel Transilvania â€“ I Expected More!
The room was spacious and the bed was relatively comfortable, but the soundproofing was terrible. I could hear noises from the hallway and from the rooms next door, which made it very difficult to rest. In addition, the air conditioning made a strange noise at night.
Breakfast was one of the positive points. Although it was not extremely varied, the items available were fresh and well prepared. The breads and cakes were tasty, and there were good options of fruits and drinks. They could improve the replenishment, since some items ran out quickly and took a while to be replaced.
The staff was polite and attentive. Unlike other areas of the hotel, the service was a pleasant surprise. At check-in, I was well received, and the staff were helpful in providing information about the city. When I asked for an extra towel, it took a while, but I was warned about the waiting time. Check-out was also smooth and hassle-free.
The room was clean, but there were some details that left something to be desired. The bathroom had a slight unpleasant odor, and the carpet looked like it needed a deeper cleaning.
The Wi-Fi connection was weak and unstable. For those who need to work or watch something without interruptions, it is definitely not a good option.
The pool seemed to be one of the positive points, but it was not as well-maintained as in the photos. In addition, the sauna was out of service during the entire stay.
The location is good, close to restaurants and tourist attractions, but the hotel is in a busy area, which contributed to the excessive noise.
Despite some positive points, the experience fell short of expectations. The improvement in service was a plus, but the Wi-Fi and cleanliness still leave something to be desired.
I would probably stay here again if they made improvements in some aspects, especially maintenance and Wi-Fi.
